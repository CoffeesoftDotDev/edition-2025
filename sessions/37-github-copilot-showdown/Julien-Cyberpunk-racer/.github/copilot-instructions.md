# Project Intent : 1 hour Game Jam
## Vision
This repository is intended at building as fast as possible a running demo of a simple retrogame.
Three competing developers will have the same instructions and constraints to follow during the 1 hour game jam : a winner will be designated for the one with a working game to be played
## Problem statement
The developer will have 1 hour to develop a game in the chosen language, with a strong expectation on having a working draft of a gameplay with an imposed theme.

## Success criteria 
- [] Having a running demo is the strongest requirement.
- [] The game implements the basic mechanics of the genre
- [] Special attention given to the game graphical content to represent the given theme
- [] The winner will be designated through applause meter during a dev conference.

## Constraints 
- Technical:
  - ** KEEP IT SIMPLE **
  - No enterprise ready software architecture : Only the necessary components to have a quick and dirty running gameplay to demo at each step of the iterative development.
  - Gamer will need to be able to interact with the game via given Input methods (Keyboard, Mouse, Gamepad)
  - Use as much out of the box components from the game engine, refrain from reinventing the wheel.
- Time : ** 1 hour ONLY **
- Resources : Only 1 Developer with any Github Copilot or remote mcp capabilities

## Non-Goals
- This project will not be maintained or updated after the Game Jam : focus on making it work. 
- This project will not be deployed, ** do not generate ** Infrastucrure as code, CICD pipelines, Unit testing or enterprise ready software scaffolding
- No need for human readable documentation files
